    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi there! My name is Emily Rodriguez and I am a freelance graphic designer based in New York City. With a passion for clean, modern design, I specialize in creating visually striking and effective branding, marketing materials, and website designs for small businesses and entrepreneurs.</p>
    <p>As a graduate of the School of Visual Arts with a Bachelor's degree in Graphic Design, I have honed my skills in typography, color theory, and composition. I am constantly seeking to expand my knowledge and stay up-to-date with the latest design trends and technologies.</p>
    <p>When I'm not working on design projects, you can usually find me exploring the city's museums and galleries or trying out new restaurants with friends. I am also an avid reader and love to curl up with a good book on weekends.</p>
    <p>If you're interested in working together, please don't hesitate to <a href="mailto:emily@example.com">reach out</a>! I would love to hear about your project and see how I can help bring your vision to life.</p
